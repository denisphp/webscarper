scraper
=======
An auto-scraper for https://habrahabr.ru/ written in PHP on Yii2 Framework.

## How it Works

The script works by crawling https://habrahabr.ru/ flow pages looking for publications.
It scans all publications on each flow and if it finds any it takes goes by publication URL grabs title, html and stores to PostgreSQL.
Web scarper has console application which is scan resources in background every two hours looking for new publications and once a day for getting publication versions if any.

* Get new articles
```
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /var/www/webscarper/
$ ./yii article/create
```
* Check and update publication versions
```
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /var/www/webscarper/
$ ./yii article/update
```
